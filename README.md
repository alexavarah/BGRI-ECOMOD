This is a farm/field level model developed to evaluate the economic consequences of changes in land use/farm management 
with a focus on black-grass (Alopecurus myusoroides) management strategies.
The model is capable of accommodating changes in farm management options such as crop types, length of rotation, tillage practices, 
seed rate and delayed sowing.
It also incorporates yield penalties due to crop rotation/ sequence, delayed sowing and level of black-grass infestation.
